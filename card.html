			<p>The German Shepherd or Alsatian is a German breed of working dog of medium to large size. The breed 
				was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs from 1899.
				It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other 
				types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work, and warfare.</p>
